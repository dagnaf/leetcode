# Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II## Description```Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node". What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work? Note: You may only use constant extra space. For example, Given the following binary tree, 1 / \ 2 3 / \ \ 4 5 7 After calling your function, the tree should look like: 1 -> NULL / \ 2 -> 3 -> NULL / \ \ 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL```link: https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/description/difficulty: Medium## Discussion```对每一层保存一个指针，由于节点内部自带一个next指针，所以可以完成O(1)空间复杂度下的层次遍历```favorite: 1
