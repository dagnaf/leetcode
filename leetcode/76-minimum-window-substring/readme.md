# Minimum Window Substring## Description``` Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n). For example, S = "ADOBECODEBANC" T = "ABC" Minimum window is "BANC". Note: If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.```link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/difficulty: Hard## Discussion```1、先找到第一个符合的滑动窗口，从左边缩小窗口直到不符合。2、这个过程中可能会发现有更小的窗口，更新答案。3、当不符合时，重新向右边扩大窗口，直到符合。4、重复1-3至字符串结尾。```favorite: 1
